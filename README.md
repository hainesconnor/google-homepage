Reflection (upong completing project):
This was hard! Ultimately, I'm happy with how the page looks. However, my .css file is ad hoc and a bit unweidly. I suspect that's a sign of not having a great grasp of css yet. I learned a lot playing around with different commands, but I still have lots to learn before I'll feel comfortable with css.
